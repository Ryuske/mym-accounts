# mym-accounts
Micro Services API For MYM Accounts written in Laravel

I need to figure something out about documentation, but, I have no idea what I am going to do about that yet.

Current Ideas:
* Keep all micro-service APIs in one place
* Use GitHub Wiki per project
* Should probably document internal code things too, not just external API usage?

## To-Do
Currently, everything works fine and there isn't much 'to-do' (may end up getting rid of this & just using GitHub issues)
